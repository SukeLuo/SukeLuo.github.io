## Huge changes of Debt-to GDP ratio of different countries
This is a time-based dot plot for more than 40 countries (I planned to delete some rows and display only a few countries. But I was unsure if I was allowed to remove them). The prupose of it is to show the instant ratio of specific year of all the countries, which can give audiences a sense of how each country performs on this function.
