#Assignment 2: Visualizing government debt

## General government debt from OECD
A bar graph embeded from OECD website which you can hover around bars and click bars for details.

## Dept-to-GDP ratio of individual countries
This is a line chart of Dept-to-GDP for different countries. On this graph you can visually see the trend for each country by year, and time frame is 1995 to 2021. If you hover along those lines, you can see the information of each year.

## Huge changes of Debt-to GDP ratio of different countries
This is a time-based dot plot for more than 40 countries. The prupose of it is to show the instant ratio of specific year of all the countries, which can give audiences a sense of how each country performs on this function. Then they can make a rough comparison.

## Comparison of three data visualizations:
The first one: An official bar graph including many sidebars which could be used to change time, variables, and display different countries. It is good for comparison during same time period. But it becomes messy when I tried to compare countries' ratio from longer time period.

The second one: The clearest one for displaying ratio change trend of each country. But it is too hard to overlay lines in mind and make comparison in a specific year.

The third one: The reason I chose this type is that I couldn't compare countries' ratio from longer time period in any of other two graphs. I planned to delete some rows and display only a few countries. But I was unsure if I was allowed to remove them. So the current chart is not clean as I expected. This one is good for showing max and min ratio of countries, and also make comparisons. But it is hard to match the year with ratio if there is no animation (I'm still learning flourish, and I will try to make this graph cleaner and nicer). 

Three visualizations have different functions. We can choose which to use based on our purpose and audiences.
