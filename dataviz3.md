# Assignment 3 & 4 Critique by Design
## 1. Original data visualization

I suppose this is a data visualization for people who want to buy new houses or who have plans to relocate. But it could also for people who want to learn about the housing market (it was published in a real estate news magazine). I think it is effective because it lists all important information on the graph, and the purpose of this graph is to show the drastic change of home values. Normally people should have known the zip code of the places they wish to move to, so they probably also know the context and environment of the specific zip code.

The first thing I noticed is the green bars, then the title, orange lines, and the blue bars. I had a sense that those bars represented home values from different years. But I would not know the orange line is a percentage change through the years if I hadn’t checked the label at the bottom. It has two y-axes, which I’m not very familiar with.

I think it is very clear since the author covered every data needed by audiences to understand the circumstances (value changes, and the percentages). But I think there are too many grids in the background which drew much attention, especially the vertical lines are not useful at all, and those two y-axes also cause some ambiguity since the author combines value change and percentage change. I also think the tilted location key of the x-axis is too long and hard to read. Moreover, the numbers on the bars are repetitive since there are labels on the y-axis.

If I were doing the redesign, I would try to separate two data, see the result, and then decide how to deal with these two data. I would also remove some grids, and make the grids lighter. Shorten the labels of the x-axis, only keep the zip code and states, and rotate them. I may also use darker green for home value in 2016, lighter green for it in 2000, and keep using orange for the line. I don't think this graph needs too many bright colors.

## 2. Sketch
Based on the critique above, I redesign the visualization as below:

In this sketch, I put two different data into separate graph,
