# Linyue - Personal Website.
Welcome to Linyue's personal website. You can find a lot of interesting works here.

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi! My name is Linyue Luo, and you can call me Suke(as Su-ki). I'm currently a second year student from Master of Urban Design Program. I need good data visualizations when I work on a background research for my design work, and I'm also interested in it a lot. Hopefully you can find a lot of cool things here.

# What I hope to learn
1. Create neat and beautiful charts;
2. Use color systems professionally;
3. Telling attractive stories for my design work.

# Portfolio
1. I'm currently working on a real estate competition. My teammates and I have already done a lot of design work. We plan to add some data visualization work to make our analysis solid;
2. I'm about to start working on my thesis project about a refugee camp this semester. I need some data visualizations in my background analysis to make my project aim clear to audience.
