# Wireframes / storyboards
This is a story about Magical Mushroom in Yunnan Province, which has the most plant diversity in China, is also known as "China's Kingdom of Plants". Everything is due to the large number of fungal plants in Yunnan, including an extremely high number of edible wild mushrooms. This has led to Yunnan people becoming experts in the use of wild mushrooms, but it has also led to several incidents of wild mushroom poisoning. The purpose of this project is to make people aware of the types of wild mushrooms available for use in Yunnan, to avoid accidental consumption of toxic mushrooms, to learn how to cook them, and what to do in case of poisoning.

|People are aware of the toxicity of some wild mushrooms.        |Can the poisoning chart give a sense of the serious harm caused by eating toxic wild mushrooms or                                                                       cooking them incorrectly?                                                                        |

## Interview findings


| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|Do you think you know what wild mushrooms is? | Yes, the introduction and context are clear.|Yes             |Yes             |
|Can the poisoning chart give a sense of the serious harm caused by eating toxic wild mushrooms or cooking them incorrectly?|Yes|Yes, this chart is astonishing|Yes. But I think you should explain why there is a drop after 2011|
|Do you think putting pictures of toixc wild mushrooms can help people identify them?|Yes. But you'd better highlight the specific features|It's hard for me to identify|I think so|
|Do you have any other advice for me?|I think you can insert a video link about dishes make by mushrooms|Call to action part should be short|You can add why you choose this topic when you do the presentation|


# Identified changes for Part III
> Refine my chart. Some details are need to be modified for the consistency, like white gap on a black back ground, and also the grid line width.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pay more attention to details of charts |Refine my chart. Some details are need to be modified for the consistency, like white gap on a black back ground, and also the grid line width. |
| Photos are not that beautiful |Use photoshop to edit photos. Some photos I inserted are not compatitable with the current template, need to be edited|
| Find a way to present the story within 60s|I have too much contents now, I might delete some part, and focus on the mushroom and poisoning part.|
| Tell everyone why you choose this interesting topic| I am a mushroom eater, and Yunnan Province is my hometown. So I might add this into my presentation|

> Final thoughts: I put too much time on the shorthand website and data visualization, I haven't contribute enough to my writeup part, and also my github portfolio. I should use text as an outline helping with my website structure.


I created a Shorthand website for displaying my progress.
