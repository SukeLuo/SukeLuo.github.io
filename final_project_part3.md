# Changes made since Part II

> I edited almost every image in this story using Photoshop because the way the Shorthand template handles images is a bit weird. Some of my graphs were not displayed completely or neatly as I expected when I tried to insert a link to my Tableau Public. Therefore, I had to export a JPEG and insert an image instead, which made the whole image too large to scroll down the page quickly. To make matters worse, some images were of poor quality due to compression, so I had to re-export them multiple times until I achieved the desired result.

> In addition to image editing, I also added a graph about reported mushroom poisoning cases in every province from 2010 to 2020. However, I was not satisfied with the color system used in the graph, which I felt could be improved for better readability. Therefore, I decided to explore other options for presenting this data in the future. I also changed the position of the climate data to make the story more logical and ensure a better flow of information. Finally, I highlighted important information throughout the story to make it more engaging and informative for readers.



## The audience

> My audience consists of foreigners who are interested in trying wild mushrooms, as well as local mushroom eaters in Yunnan. For the former, I aim to provide a basic introduction to Yunnan's wild mushrooms and teach them how to safely enjoy the unique flavors that this region has to offer. It's important to me that foreigners understand the risks associated with consuming wild mushrooms and how to avoid accidental poisoning. By providing information on the types of wild mushrooms that are edible and safe to eat, as well as guidance on how to identify them, I hope to encourage safe and enjoyable experiences for all who are interested.

> For local mushroom eaters, my focus is on raising awareness about the types of edible wild mushrooms in Yunnan and the dangers of consuming toxic mushrooms. It's all too easy for even experienced foragers to mistake a toxic mushroom for a harmless one, and the consequences can be severe. Therefore, I aim to educate local people on the importance of proper identification techniques, as well as how to recognize and respond to symptoms of mushroom poisoning. By sharing this information, I hope to ensure that local mushroom eaters can continue to enjoy this beloved culinary tradition safely and confidently.

> While creating my brief introduction to Yunnan's wild mushrooms, I attempted to cover breakdown information for every city in the region. However, I found that the amount of information was overwhelming and could easily confuse readers who were seeking a basic overview. As a result, I decided to focus on providing more general information that could be useful to a broader audience.

> During my research, one of my interviewees suggested that I include a video showcasing different cooking methods for wild mushrooms. I thought this was an excellent idea, as it would help to illustrate how to prepare and enjoy the unique flavors of Yunnan's wild mushrooms. However, I faced a challenge in finding a suitable video in English.


## Final design decisions

> While conducting research for my project on wild mushrooms in Yunnan, I faced challenges in finding reliable data sources. Most of the available information related to wild mushrooms in Yunnan were reports of poisoning cases or information about toxic species that were difficult to understand because they were listed by their Latin names. I also tried to find information about the potential hallucinogenic effects of poisonous mushrooms, but I could not find any official or credible sources. Instead, I found information on social media platforms such as Weibo and Zhihu, which was difficult to synthesize.

> Given the lack of reliable information, I focused on providing readers with a basic understanding of Yunnan's wild mushrooms. I also attempted to make the information easy to recall by matching the color codes of the graphs with the background image and using the same color for highlighting. By doing this, I aimed to provide a consistent and visually engaging reading experience.

> Despite the challenges I faced during my research, I remain committed to educating readers about the unique and diverse wild mushrooms of Yunnan. I will continue to explore new sources of information and improve my presentation of the available data.

# Final thoughts

I have completed my story on Yunnan's wild mushrooms, but I am concerned that the information presented might be insufficient or uninteresting to people who are already familiar with the topic. During my presentation, I noticed that the audience was engaged because the topic was new to them.

To make the story more engaging for a wider audience, I am considering adding a section called "How to pretend you are living in Yunnan? Where to get similar mushrooms?" In this section, I can introduce some wild mushrooms that I have seen in American supermarkets and compare them to their Yunnanese counterparts. I believe that this could make the story more fun and relatable for a wider audience.

I am excited about the prospect of expanding my story and making it more accessible to a wider audience. I believe that by doing so, I can promote greater awareness and appreciation of the unique and diverse wild mushrooms of Yunnan.
