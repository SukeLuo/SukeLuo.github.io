# The final data story
> [Click to view my Final Data Story!](https://linyue-final-project.shorthandstories.com/magical-jier/index.html)


# Changes made since Part II
> I edited almost every image in this story using Photoshop because the way the Shorthand template handles images is a bit weird. Some of my graphs were not displayed completely or neatly as I expected when I tried to insert a link to my Tableau Public. Therefore, I had to export a JPEG and insert an image instead, which made the whole image too large to scroll down the page quickly. To make matters worse, some images were of poor quality due to compression, so I had to re-export them multiple times until I achieved the desired result.
> In addition to image editing, I also added a graph about reported mushroom poisoning cases in every province from 2010 to 2020. However, I was not satisfied with the color system used in the graph, which I felt could be improved for better readability. Therefore, I decided to explore other options for presenting this data in the future. I also changed the position of the climate data to make the story more logical and ensure a better flow of information. Finally, I highlighted important information throughout the story to make it more engaging and informative for readers.



## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.
> My audience consists of foreigners who are interested in trying wild mushrooms, as well as local mushroom eaters in Yunnan. For the former, I aim to provide a basic introduction to Yunnan's wild mushrooms and teach them how to safely enjoy the unique flavors that this region has to offer. It's important to me that foreigners understand the risks associated with consuming wild mushrooms and how to avoid accidental poisoning. By providing information on the types of wild mushrooms that are edible and safe to eat, as well as guidance on how to identify them, I hope to encourage safe and enjoyable experiences for all who are interested.
> For local mushroom eaters, my focus is on raising awareness about the types of edible wild mushrooms in Yunnan and the dangers of consuming toxic mushrooms. It's all too easy for even experienced foragers to mistake a toxic mushroom for a harmless one, and the consequences can be severe. Therefore, I aim to educate local people on the importance of proper identification techniques, as well as how to recognize and respond to symptoms of mushroom poisoning. By sharing this information, I hope to ensure that local mushroom eaters can continue to enjoy this beloved culinary tradition safely and confidently.
> While creating my brief introduction to Yunnan's wild mushrooms, I attempted to cover breakdown information for every city in the region. However, I found that the amount of information was overwhelming and could easily confuse readers who were seeking a basic overview. As a result, I decided to focus on providing more general information that could be useful to a broader audience.
> During my research, one of my interviewees suggested that I include a video showcasing different cooking methods for wild mushrooms. I thought this was an excellent idea, as it would help to illustrate how to prepare and enjoy the unique flavors of Yunnan's wild mushrooms. However, I faced a challenge in finding a suitable video in English.


## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary.  If you do this, you probably want to include a link from Shorthand to this page.
